3. Responsibilities of Each Component
3.1 Java (Spring Boot) — Orchestration Layer

Java is responsible for the structural and operational backbone of the system.
Its main responsibilities include:

Exposing REST APIs to the client

Validating and processing incoming requests

Communicating with the Python ML Engine

Managing database interactions via JPA/Hibernate

Running background schedulers (e.g., data refresh jobs)

Applying business rules and system workflows

Spring Boot brings reliability, modularity, and enterprise-level organization.

3.2 Python ML Engine — Intelligence Layer

Python handles all machine learning logic due to its flexibility and rich ecosystem.
Its responsibilities include:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Executing recommendation algorithms

Loading/saving trained models

Responding to Java via a REST or subprocess interface

Updating ML outputs back into PostgreSQL

Logging model performance

Python acts as the “brain” of the system.

3.3 PostgreSQL — Persistence Layer

PostgreSQL stores all structured data used by the system.
Its responsibilities include:

User behavior data

Product catalog

Recommendation history

Model metadata

System logs

Integration tables for Java ↔ Python communication

PostgreSQL provides consistency, transactions, indexing, and relational organization.

3.4 Communication Layer (Java ↔ Python)

The two languages communicate through:

REST API (FastAPI or Flask) – recommended

or

Subprocess call (Java runs Python scripts directly)

Responsibilities:

Ensure secure communication

Transfer data (JSON)

Keep both services independent and modular
